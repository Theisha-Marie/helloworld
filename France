      <h2>A Weekend on the Seine

        <h4>Day1
            <div></div>
            <br />
            On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away.
                <br />Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!)  <br />
              We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>.

          <h4>Day2
            <div></div>
        <br />
            On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>.  <br />
            Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br />
After we finished shopping,we visited some really beautiful places! We went to
<em>Notre Dame</em>.<br />
We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer.  <br />
After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.

          <h4>Day 3
              <div></div>
              <br />
            The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>.  <br />
            It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>.  <br />
            Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking.  <br />
            I was surprised to see that the museum also had many  <br />
            sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.
